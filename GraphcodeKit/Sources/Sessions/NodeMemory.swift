/// - `graphcoded` appends objective episode records (pass started, resolved, metric
///   readings, staged hand-offs) via `GraphStore`'s `onAppendMemory` hook — facts that
///   exist even when a session crashed and can't be trusted to self-report.
/// - The session itself appends learned notes through `graphcode node memo …` — the
///   *why* only the agent knows.
///
/// Files live under the support directory, never inside the user's project: graphcode
/// never writes into an opened folder, and a log in the worktree would be clobbered by
/// the very git operations the loop performs.
///
/// The digest is delivered by *path*, the `SessionBriefing` lesson: a typed launch
/// command tops out under `MAX_CANON`, so the pointer is ~90 bytes and the file is free
