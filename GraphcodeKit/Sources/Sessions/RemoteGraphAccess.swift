/// on that host, and the installer fragment that delivers them over the launch's own
/// ssh dial (issue #41 — before this, remote loops couldn't fan out at all).
///
/// **The shim is Python, not the Swift CLI, deliberately.** The real `graphcode` is a
/// macOS binary; the hosts remote projects live on mostly aren't Macs, and
/// cross-compiling GraphcodeKit for every remote platform would be a build system for
/// one file. python3 is already the launch path's scripting dependency (the Copilot
/// trust seed), it's validated at add-connection time the same way `zmx` is, and the
/// wire protocol it has to speak is four bytes of length plus JSON. The shim covers the
/// verbs the briefing teaches — create, send, memo, status, mailroom — and says so
/// for the rest, rather than half-implementing all of them.
///
/// **Paths are `~/`-relative on purpose.** Nothing local knows the remote home
/// directory, and every consumer expands them on the remote host itself: the installer
/// through `os.path.expanduser`, argv paths through the remote login shell (see
/// `ZmxSessionLauncher.remoteQuotedCommand`).

    USAGE
      graphcode projects
      graphcode status <project-path>
      graphcode node create <project-path> --title <t> --type <turn|goal|time|composite> [options]
      graphcode node stop <project-path> <node-id>
      graphcode node restart <project-path> <node-id>  kill its session, resume it in place
      graphcode node delete <project-path> <node-id>   irreversible; stop is reversible
      graphcode node send <project-path> <node-id> <message...>
      graphcode node memo <project-path> <node-id> <note...>
      graphcode node done <project-path> <node-id> [result...]
      graphcode mail post <project-path> [--topic <t>] <notice...>
      graphcode mail inbox <project-path> [--headlines] [--full] [--mark] [--json]
      graphcode mail read <project-path> <post-id>
      graphcode mail list <project-path> [--search <text>] [--json]
      graphcode mail watch <project-path> [--topic <t>] [--off]

    SAFETY
      Use `graphcode projects` to discover paths and `graphcode status` before retrying.
      `node stop` is reversible; `node delete` removes the node, edges, memory and
      session irreversibly. `--help` and `-h` only print help. The machine-wide
      `graphcode reap` recovery runs on the Mac, not this remote host: use it only there,
      and run `graphcode reap --dry-run` before the destructive form.

    MAILROOM
      The shared board any loop can post to and any loop can read -- check it at the
      start of a pass. `sync` and `watch` are the calling loop's, so they need a
      session ($ZMX_SESSION); `list` and `read` are read-only and move no cursor. A
      large backlog prints as headlines and says so -- deep-read with `read <post-id>`.

    NODE OPTIONS
      --into <composite-id>  create inside that composite's sub-graph
      --check <text>         what a human verifies each turn (--type turn)
      --goal <text>          required for --type goal
      --predicate <cmd>      optional stop condition for --type goal (exit 0 = met)
      --prompt <text>        required for --type time or turn; a time loop's cadence
                             goes inside it (/loop 1h ...)
      --backend <name>       claudeCode | copilotCLI | codex | openCode | pi
      --model <tier>         fast | standard | capable
      --metric <cmd>         performance measure; last stdout line must be a number
      --direction <d>        minimize | maximize (default: maximize)

      1   bad usage, or graphcoded refused the command
