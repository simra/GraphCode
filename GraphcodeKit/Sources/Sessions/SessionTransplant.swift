///
/// Each backend gets the most its CLI supports, which is not the same amount:
///
/// - **Claude Code** transplants fully. Its transcripts are per-project JSONL files
///   named by session id, and an id-rewritten copy dropped into the target project's
///   directory resumes with complete context (verified empirically: a transplanted
///   session recalled facts from before the move).
/// - **Copilot** transplants its whole `session-state/<id>/` directory under a fresh
///   id, text files rewritten. `--resume` restores from exactly that directory. If a
///   given Copilot build refuses the transplant, the ensure dial's resume-dead
///   fallback already starts the loop fresh — degradation, not breakage.
/// - **Codex cannot resume at all** (`supportsResume` is false), so its rollout rides
///   along as carried history — readable in the bundle, installed under
///   `~/.codex/sessions` for `codex`'s own pickers — and the imported loop's session
///   starts fresh, exactly as every Codex relaunch does.
/// - **pi** transplants fully. Each session is one JSONL file under
///   `~/.pi/agent/sessions/<cwd slug>/` whose header line names its id and cwd; the copy
///   is installed under the target's slug with both rewritten, and `--session <id>`
///   resumes it. A session found only under another project's slug would stop at pi's
///   interactive "fork into current directory?" prompt, so the slug is not optional.
