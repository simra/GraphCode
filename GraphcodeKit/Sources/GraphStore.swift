/// Lives in `GraphcodeKit`, not `graphcoded/Sources`, even though only the daemon
/// instantiates it in production: it has no socket/process-lifecycle coupling of its

/// cleanly unit-testable from `graphcodeTests` without spinning up a real daemon
/// process or socket.

/// No `.global` Orchestrator Graph yet (still deferred, see `LoopGraph`'s doc comment).
/// This actor itself still has no persistence of its own — from Phase 4 on that's

/// owns exactly one graph and has no notion of "which project" it belongs to.
