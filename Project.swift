import ProjectDescription

// Graphcode: a native macOS orchestrator for a graph of agentic loops.
// See docs/03-architecture.md for the full component breakdown this project scaffolds.
//
// Three products today:
//   - `GraphcodeKit` — shared static framework: Domain types, the daemon<->app IPC
//     protocol, and the PTY session primitive both `graphcode` and `graphcoded` launch
//     CLI backends through. Static, not dynamic, so `graphcoded` (a plain command-line
//     tool with nowhere sensible to embed a dynamic framework) can link it directly.
//   - `graphcode`   — the SwiftUI app (the UI process).
//   - `graphcoded`  — the background orchestrator daemon. From Phase 3 on it's no
//     longer an empty skeleton: it owns the real `LoopGraph` state, fires `.handoff`
//     edges automatically, and arms time-based triggers that survive the app quitting
//     — see docs/07-roadmap.md#phase-3--orchestrator-automation.

// Both are overridable so a development build can run *beside* an installed release
// instead of replacing it. macOS keys far too much off the bundle id — Login Items,
// LaunchServices' "which app owns this?", the background-agent attribution — so two
// builds sharing one id fight over all of it.
//
//     TUIST_BUNDLE_ID_PREFIX=com.example.graphcode-localdev \
//     TUIST_APP_DISPLAY_NAME="GraphCode (localdev)" \
//       mise exec -- tuist generate --no-open
//
// The bundle id is only half of side-by-side: state is keyed by
// `GRAPHCODE_SUPPORT_DIR` (see `SupportDirectory`), and a second build sharing
// `~/.graphcode` would share graphs and zmx session names with the release and fight
// over the sessions. Set both, or use `make dev-*`, which sets both for you.
