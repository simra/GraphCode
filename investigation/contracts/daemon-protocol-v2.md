# Daemon protocol v2 contract

## Compatibility

- Existing protocol-v1 frames remain valid.
- The daemon identifies v2 only when a frame contains the explicit envelope `version` or
  `kind` fields.
- A v2 client sends `hello` and negotiates the highest shared version.
- Protocol-v1 clients continue receiving their existing event shapes.
- Protocol-v1 retirement is outside the Windows port.

## Envelope

Protocol v2 uses the existing four-byte big-endian frame header and a bounded JSON payload.

Kinds:

- `hello`: supported versions
- `request`: request ID and `DaemonCommand`
- `response`: request ID and either a `DaemonEvent` or explicit `success: true` with no
  payload
- `event`: sequence and `DaemonEvent`
- `error`: optional request ID plus stable code/message

The v2 envelope payload is limited to 1 MiB after the envelope is identified. Legacy v1
frames retain their UInt32 length header and are accepted through the documented 2 MiB
legacy safety ceiling, which bounds allocation while preserving the deployed oversized
fixtures. Transport implementations must handle partial reads/writes, deadlines,
cancellation, backpressure, and non-reading peers.

## Subscription and reconnect

- Responses are correlated only by request ID.
- Events carry a monotonically increasing connection-visible sequence.
- `hello` may carry a `clientID`, `resumeFrom` cursor, and an optional project-path
  subscription allow-list. An omitted allow-list subscribes to every joined project.
- The daemon keeps a bounded replay window per logical `clientID` (128 events by default),
  with bounded client count and expiry, independent of a socket. A reconnect replays events
  strictly after `resumeFrom`; unknown or expired history receives `replayUnavailable`, while
  a cursor beyond the retained latest sequence receives `cursorOutsideWindow`.
- Subscriptions are tracked per socket for filtering, while canonical retention uses the
  union of all sockets for a logical client; one socket cannot narrow another socket's
  replay history.
- Canonical subscribed graph events are retained for a logical client while its socket is
  disconnected, subject to the same bounded capacity and expiry.
- When retention capacity is full of active clients, an overflow client may receive live
  events without a replay buffer; later promotion preserves its sequence and watermark
  state rather than resetting or duplicating visible sequences.
- Canonical graph appends retry admission for eligible overflow clients before assigning
  their event sequence, so an inactive retained client can be evicted and the active
  client promoted on the production broadcast path.
- With `maxClients: 0`, active clients still share monotonic append/snapshot sequences and
  watermarks, but retain no replay history; after final disconnect, reconnect starts a new
  sequence window and an older cursor is outside that window.
- Replay frames are queued before live events, preserving sequence order across reconnect.
- Every newly connected app socket completes the restore/global join pair exactly once before
  an ordinary project-scoped command; concurrent reader and sender paths share that join.
- The live-event queue used while replay is in progress is bounded by both event count and
  encoded bytes. A slow connection that exceeds either bound is failed and closed rather
  than allowed to grow daemon memory without limit.
- Multiple sockets sharing one logical client receive the same broadcast envelope and
  sequence; project membership is reference-counted by socket, so one socket leaving does
  not detach a project still joined by another.
- A connection-local join snapshot consumes a visible sequence but records a replay
  non-replayable gap, so another socket's snapshot cannot invalidate the first socket's
  resume cursor; disconnecting immediately after the snapshot and resuming from that cursor
  is an exact caught-up replay rather than `replayUnavailable`.
- Non-replayable snapshot metadata is compacted into bounded ranges within the replay
  window, and a disconnected socket's subscription record is removed while logical
  client history remains eligible for retention.
- Complete framed writes are serialized at the transport boundary, including concurrent app
  sends.
- Unix transport close waits behind the frame-write queue and rejects later writes, so a
  descriptor cannot be closed and reused while an earlier header/payload pair is active.
- Replay stores run periodic expiry cleanup while the daemon is idle; expiry does not
  require a subsequent append or reconnect attempt.
- Responses and errors are not replayed. They are correlated to the request that produced
  them, while subscription events remain sequenced.
- Transcript pages use this correlated response path exclusively. They are bounded and
  redacted by the daemon and never enter graph snapshots, subscription broadcasts, or
  replay history; see `transcript-read.md`.
- A rejected graph command returns its correlated error and never a successful response
  snapshot.
- Before a v2 graph mutation is applied, the daemon preflights both its correlated response
  and sequenced event envelope against the 1 MiB cap; an oversized result is rejected
  without graph or persistence mutation. Legacy v1 commands retain their larger frame
  compatibility.
- After the handshake, an idle socket has no global inactivity timeout. Once the first byte
  of a frame arrives, the remaining header and payload share one cumulative read deadline.
- A successful mutation with no response payload returns a correlated response envelope
  with `success: true`.
- A reconnect never silently treats an unrelated event as command acknowledgement.

## Test fixtures

- Frozen current Swift CLI command.
- Frozen current macOS app command/event exchange.
- Frozen delivered Python remote-shim command.
- Interleaved v2 requests and events.
- Unsupported version, malformed envelope, partial/oversized frame, timeout, and reconnect.
